# AltSource Bank!

Welcome to my single-page application to handle authentication and account transactions built with:

*   [ASP.NET Core](https://get.asp.net/) and [C#](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/67ef8sbd.aspx) for cross-platform server-side code
*   [Angular](https://angular.io/) and [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) for client-side code
*   [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for layout and styling

Accounts are securely saved in a JSON file on the server, passwords encoded with SHA256\. The angular app uses services to communicate with the backend API and update the UI.

To start, open the project in Visual Studio and start in debug or production. (npm should be installed on the system)

**This app should serve to achieve the following goals:**

1.  Create a new account
2.  Login 
3.  Record a deposit
4.  Record a withdrawl
5.  Check balance 
6.  See transaction history
7.  Logout
